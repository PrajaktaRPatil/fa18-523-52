Introduction

KNIME is a platform that can perform intense analytics on a GUI and user-friendly workflow. KNIME is diverse in that its users do not necessarily need to know coding languages to use it. KNIME is a process-oriented, single base workflow with basic input/output manipulations. KNIME is an open source platform that uses thousands of its documented nodes within the node repository for use in the Knime workbench. The collection of nodes that creates a KNIME workbench is able to be executed locally or within the KNIME web portal on its own server [@fa18-523-52-guided].
