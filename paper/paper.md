Introduction

KNIME is a platform that can perform intense data analytics on a graphical user interface and incorporate a user-friendly workflow. It incorporates large or small data sets and even projects as broad as deep learning. KNIME is diverse in that its users do not necessarily need to know any coding languages to use it. KNIME is a process-oriented, single base workflow with basic input/output manipulations. KNIME is an open source platform that uses thousands of its documented nodes within the node repository for use in the Knime workbench. A node is a single processing point of data manipulations within your workflow. A workflow is described as a sequence of steps a user follows in their platform that is used to complete their final product [@fa18-532-52-workflow]. The collection of nodes that creates a KNIME workbench is able to be executed locally or within the KNIME web portal on its own server. The workflow that KNIME follows first begins with data collection, data cleaning, data integration, and finally, feature extraction. This workflow allows for large files such as a CSV to be accessed through the web portal and it can therefore be manipulated through several wizards [@fa18-523-52-guided]. 

Knime Used in Big Data

KNIME is useful in Big Data applications because it aids in the process of guided analytics. Guided analytics is a process that functions by providing automation to data science projects. This usage brings to light some of the features of big data that are sometimes hidden when visualization tools are unused. Depending on the wizard the user selects, the data can then be viewed in a formatted table using forward feature selection methods. This means that the user can then select their data based on the most accurate correlating information. This will, of course, be varied based on the type of information that is entered into the table. The next step in the data-selection process is a second screen with a wizard that asks the user to choose a target variable. The next screen will then show to offer a selection of algorithms which the user can use to entrain the dataset. After choosing an algorithm, the user mmay browse from a list of displayed visualizations that include their dataset such as bar graphs, an ROC curve, and more. The user can then download their data model in a PMML format, which is universally configurable in any enterprise application. The steps to download and set up your KNIME platform is quite simple. First, go to the KNIME website and obtain the download. Then, install KNIME and set its working directory for KNIME to store its files in. To set up a KNIME workflow, go to the File menu on the platform and choose New. Give your workflow a name and then click Finish. This process establishes a basic, empty workflow in which users can drage nodes from the repositories on the left-hand side into the workflow space. 

An example of big data analysis hosted by KNIME is a store trying to compare its products sold over multiple store locations. The first step in the visualization process would be to import your data. Within the workflow, users can view differences or find a possible correlation in their dataset by searching for linear correlation in the repository. After choosing this feature, the user must connect the data set to the linear correlation node via a line on the workflow grid. The execute option can then be chosen to view the correlation matrix. The user can hover over a specific cell to select the feature you want to use for further prediction. The next few steps are used in visualization and analysis of user data. Under the Views tab, the user can search for different graphs or plots. A scatter plot, in this case, would be a great way to visualize data from multiple items within a store. You then must drag and drop it and connect it within the workflow like before. You can then configure just how many rows that you would like to look at. 

KNIME also includes nodes that can show missing values from certain datasets.
