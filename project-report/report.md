Abstract

One major area that is being utilized highly today within big data platforms is
that of medical image collection. Medical image datasets are often used as 
training tools as a source of comparison when analyzing diagnostic images from
current or past cases of diseases. The issue in this field is that current 
datasets lack the diversity and number of samples that is necessary to make
sufficient predictions based on analysis. The HAM10000 dataset is a significant 
resource for analysis because it includes over 10,000 dermatoscopic images
that have been carefully stained and optimized to display skin-lesion biopsies.
The grafts entered into this dataset were verified and therefore proven worthy
based on expert consensus, a follow-up, and in-vivo microscopy. Each individual
donation is tracked by its patient identification number, image identification
number, donor age, donor sex, localization on the body, and a final inclusion
verification reasoning.
